## Tutorial Summary

### 1. Install FFmpeg
- brew install ffmpeg
- or however else you want to do it. 

### 2. Select Folders
- Use the toolbar folder buttons to pick input and output directories. (or drag and drop)
- Keyboard shortcuts: `⌘O` for input and `⌘⇧O` for output.

### 2. Choose Mode
- `Encode`: Converts videos to H.265/H.264 (HEVC) for smaller files while preserving good quality.
