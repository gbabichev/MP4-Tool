MP4 Tool is a simple ffmpeg frontend that lets you convert or remux video files into MP4 containers with a streamlined macOS interface.

MP4 Tool supports H264 & H265 encoding, and remuxing (copying streams but converting to MP4)

You must have ffmpeg & ffprobe in your $PATH, or compile the app with ffmpeg & ffprobe in the Resources directory. I will not redistribute the binaries, but I have attached my ffmpeg build script. 

## Tutorial Summary

### 1. Select Folders
- Use the toolbar folder buttons to pick input and output directories.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `⌘O` for input and `⌘⇧O` for output.

### 2. Choose Mode
- `Encode`: Converts videos to H.265 (HEVC) for smaller files while preserving good quality.
- `Remux`: Copies existing streams without re-encoding for a fast, lossless workflow.
- Both modes save results as MP4 files.

### 3. Adjust Settings
- In Encode mode, configure the CRF quality (recommended range 18–28, where lower values produce higher quality).
- Optional settings let you manage subfolders and control whether original files are deleted after processing.

### 4. Start Processing
- Click **Start Processing** or press `⌘P` to run the selected jobs.
- Watch progress and logs in the lower section of the window.
